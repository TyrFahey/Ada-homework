********************
Hello! My name is Tyra (she/her) and I'm a prospective strudent at Ada Developer's Academy in Seattle, WA. Before this I was a chef and chocolatier for over 10 years, from commercial bakeries to tiny single cook kitchens to fine cuisine, I saw it all. Everywhere I went, in every kitchen, there were inefficencies and poorly constructed systems somewhere. At first I was inspired to learn coding and system administration to correct problems I saw around me, and then to find new things to learn as I realized that I could do so much more with code.

After my years dealing with fire, adversity and the unexpected, I crave a challenge. I'm excited to have a chance to grow and study with a group of women and non-binary individuals determined to survive out there in the world of Tech.
