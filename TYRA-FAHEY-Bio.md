********************
Hello! My name is Tyra (she/her) and I'm a prospective student at Ada Developer's Academy in Seattle, WA. Before this I was a chef and chocolatier for over 10 years. From commercial bakeries to tiny single cook kitchens to fine cuisine - everywhere I went, in every kitchen, there were inefficiencies and poorly constructed systems somewhere costing everyone money and time. At first I was inspired to learn coding and system administration to correct just the problems I saw around me, and then to find new things to learn as I realized that I could do so much more with code.

Now, after my years dealing with flames, adversity and the unexpected, I crave a challenge! I'm excited to have a chance to grow and study with a group of women and non-binary individuals determined to survive out there in the sometimes harsh world of Tech. I hope that after completing the program I will be able to move out into the world and lift up myself and the people around me to new heights. I don't just want to succeed, I want all of us to thrive, and that can only happen once we break through the inertia that prevents new ideas from truly flourishing.
